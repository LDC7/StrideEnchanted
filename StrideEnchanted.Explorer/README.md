# StrideEnchanted.Explorer

Web-based scene explorer for Stride Engine games.  
It allows you to explore your game's live scene graph — from a browser on a second screen or a different device.  
It also allows you to edit properties of your entity components.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Inside your `Program.cs` or wherever you configure the host:

```csharp
    builder.AddStrideExplorer();
```
